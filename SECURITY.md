# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Use this section to inform users about which versions of WarpXIO are currently supported with security updates. Since this is a new project, we’ll start with the initial version and plan for future releases.

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 0.1.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| < 0.1   | :x:                |

*Note*: As WarpXIO is in early development, only the latest 0.1.x releases are supported. Future versions (e.g., 0.2.x, 1.0.x) will be added as they are released, with security updates provided for the latest two minor versions.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Use this section to guide users on how to report security issues effectively.

- **Where to Report**: Please submit vulnerability reports via a private GitHub issue to the WarpXIO repository (https://github.com/yourusername/warpxio/issues/new?assignees=&labels=security&template=security-vulnerability-report.md). This ensures confidentiality until the issue is resolved.
- **Response Time**: You can expect an initial acknowledgment within 3-5 business days. Updates will follow weekly or as progress warrants.
- **What to Expect**: 
  - If accepted, we’ll work with you to validate and fix the vulnerability, crediting you in the changelog (with your permission).
  - If declined, we’ll explain why (e.g., out of scope, not exploitable) and close the issue.
- **Process**: Include details like the affected version, steps to reproduce, and potential impact. Encrypted communication is available upon request.

*Note*: WarpXIO prioritizes user privacy with local execution (e.g., via Ollama). However, please avoid public disclosure until a patch is released to prevent exploitation.
